Active Ragdoll Character Toolkit by Tilde Asterisk ~*
=======
Turn humanoid character models into active ragdolls, with physics driven procedural animation and collisions.

* âš¡ Fun fact: Ragdoll physics is a type of procedural animation used by physics engines, which is often used as a replacement for traditional static death animations in video games and animated films. As computers increased in power, it became possible to do limited real-time physical simulations, which made death animations more realistic.
